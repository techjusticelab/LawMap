# Phase 02 – Multistate Expansion (TODO)

- [ ] Generalize normalizers to handle multiple jurisdictions (code keys, section formats).
- [ ] Add 2–3 additional states with official bulk sources first; document source configs.
- [ ] Implement crosswalks for code key aliases and historical renumbers.
- [ ] Enhance dedup/merge rules; prefer latest effective version per jurisdiction.
- [ ] Expand API to expose jurisdiction filters and breadcrumbs.
- [ ] Add rate limiting/backoff and source-specific politeness settings.
- [ ] Broaden E2E tests with multi-state fixtures.
- [ ] Extend classification taxonomy; validate `HAS_TOPIC` across jurisdictions.
