This project structure was just created by GPT (weird I never use it but my claude is busy rn and scraed of usage limit)

The aim for this project is to create a graph based API with all of US Law on it. 
The pilot will be for california and will want help integrating across the rest of the states. I want to do this because 
1. I am building a product for this NGO to help california public defenders effecitnly do their job. They are so severly underfunded rn and with the current administration there is really no prospect of that changing. In the next couple years we will see AI take over everything, currently this is going to be done by big tec companies. Law is already bared by lexus nexus and westlaw, they pretty much have a monopoloy on how all of law is practiced in this country. I want to build good open source software to actually help them do their jobs the best that they can. 
2. I don't understand the law, I am a 21 year old philosiphy student at Berkeley and the documentation online is really shit (at least the free stuff). 
3. No one really understands the law completly as it is over complicated and from a systems engeninering perspective this is really bad. We are probs writing a lot of duplicate and contridictory laws rn. This would be a good project of journlism to do. Maybe we can get a little more civil because of it.
